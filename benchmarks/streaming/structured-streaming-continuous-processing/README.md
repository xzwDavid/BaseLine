# Millisecond-Level Latencies with Continuous Processing Mode in Structured Streaming 

The Databricks Archive file (.dbc) in this directory contains notebooks that demonstrate the low-latency behavior of the Continuous Processing streaming mode, new in Apache Spark 2.3. 

To run the notebook:
- Download the .dbc file to your local computer, and import it into your Databricks workspace. You can use a free account in [*Databricks Community Edition*](https://community.cloud.databricks.com). See [our docs](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/index.html#importing-notebooks) for guidance on importing.
- Create a new cluster with **Databricks Runtime Version 4.0 (includes Apache Spark 2.3.0)** (or newer) and **1 worker** (if not on *Databricks Community Edition*). 
- Attach this notebook to the cluster and click **"Run All"**.
